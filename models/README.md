- Purpose: store serialized model artifacts (`.pkl`) used for inference and reproducibility.

- Expected models:
  - `rf_fraud_tuned.pkl` — model trained on `fraud_data_processed.csv`.
  - `rf_creditcard_tuned.pkl` — model trained on `creditcard_processed.csv`.

- Generated by: run `notebooks/modeling.ipynb` (training and serialization).

- Note: Models are large and excluded from Git (`.gitignore`).
